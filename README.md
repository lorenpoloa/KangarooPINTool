# KangarooPINTool
Some PIN Tool for Computer Architecture Labs.


This is a tool developed using the [Intel¬Æ Pin](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html) framework.
## Requirements

- Intel PIN (not included, download from the official website)
- Compatible compiler (gcc/g++, clang, etc.)


## What is Kangaroo PIN Tools
Is a set of PIN Tools to get stats about jumps instructions in a program.

### JumpsStatsSimple
Simple stats about the number of conditional jumps instructions and the ratio of taken jumps.

### JumpsStatsByType
More detailed stats about each type of jumps instructions and the ratio of them that are taken.

### JumpsStatsWithPredictor
Stats about differents jumps predictors simulations

## How to use

üõ†Ô∏è Compiling and Using <br>

Copy all files from this repository to [your pin path]/source/tools/JumpsTools



Compile:
```bash

make
```

Exec with PIN:
```bash

pin -t JumpsStatsSimple.so -- ./your_program

```


## JumpsStatsByType 
## üìò Manual and Description

### üìù General Description
JumpsStatsByType is an instrumentation tool developed with Intel¬Æ Pin Tool. Its goal is to collect detailed statistics of branch instructions executed by a program, classified by jump type (e.g., je, jne, jmp, call, etc.).

The tool analyzes whether each branch was taken or not taken and provides a summary both by instruction type and overall.

### üîç What does it measure?
For each type of branch instruction (such as je, jmp, jne, etc.), the tool reports:

Number of times the branch was taken.

Number of times the branch was not taken.

Total number of times that branch instruction was executed.

Percentage of times the branch was taken.

Additionally, it provides a total summary of all branches encountered during program execution.


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
To use the tool, run your target program with Pin and this tool as follows:

```bash

pin -t obj-intel64/JumpsStatsByType.so -o results.txt -- ./my_program
Parameters

-t obj-intel64/JumpsStatsByType.so: path to the compiled tool file.

-o results.txt: (optional) name of the output file. If omitted, the output will be shown in the console.

-- ./my_program: the program you want to instrument and analyze.
```

### üì§ Example Output

```text
======= Branch Statistics =======
Type      Taken     Not-Taken      Total     Percent Taken

JP        0         2              2         0.00
JZ        138542    6895682        7034224   1.97
=======================================
Total Taken     = 40964646
Total Not Taken = 10252691
Total Branches  = 51217337

```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

The tool only counts branch-type instructions and classifies them by their mnemonic (e.g., jne, jmp).

It works with binaries compatible with Pin (usually in ELF or PE format).

It does not distinguish between direct and indirect branches, but you can extend it to do so.
