## Requirements

- Intel PIN (not included, download from the official website)
- Compatible compiler (gcc/g++, clang, etc.)


## What is Kangaroo PIN Tools
Is a set of PIN Tools to get stats about jumps instructions in a program.

### JumpsStatsSimple
Simple stats about the number of conditional jumps instructions and the ratio of taken jumps.

### JumpsStatsByType
More detailed stats about each type of jumps instructions and the ratio of them that are taken.

### JumpsStatsWithPredictor
Stats about differents jumps predictors simulations

## How to use

üõ†Ô∏è Compiling and Using <br>
